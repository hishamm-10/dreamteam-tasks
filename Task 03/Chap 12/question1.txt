Selenium: Automates browsers for tasks like clicking, typing, or scraping dynamic pages with JavaScript.
Requests: Downloads content from static pages quickly using HTTP methods like GET and POST.
BeautifulSoup: Parses and extracts data from HTML or XML; works best with static content from Requests.
webbrowser: Opens URLs in your default browser; good for simple tasks, not for scraping or automation.
