This task was Challenging for me. I went through many Flask Tutorials and followed Tutorials to complete this task. I AI generated code at some parts of this Task. I learnt about various types of requests and the Working of the Backend for this Task. I checked the working the Endpoint requests with help of Postman and made sure the Backend is working properly. In this backend a person can see the list of movies by giving an Get request and add movies and reviews by giving an Post request. This Task was Interesting and helped to learn about the Working of an Backend.
