    In this Task of making the letterboxd clone with Next.js was Challenging for me as I made lot many mistakes while maing this project as confused with routing and various other properties with version 13 and version 15. Watching Youtube Tutorials and Googling helped to solve these issues. I tried my best to make the this project look and workmost familiar like original LetterBoxd Website. I used AI generated codes at some part of my project and use AI to learn and solve many error arised relating to code. This task was fun and challenging for me. The progess of my webpages at each part kept me Motivated. Working with TailWind CSS was a new experince for me and Completion of this Frontend of Letterboxd made me feel happy.
