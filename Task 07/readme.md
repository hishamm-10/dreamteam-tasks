## ðŸŽ¨ Wireframing Task  

For this task, I focused on replicating the core elements and structure of the original website in my wireframe. This process allowed me to visualize how my website would look and function, serving as a blueprint for development.

---

### Approach  
- **Incorporating Original Features**: Included the key components and layout present in the original website, ensuring the wireframe was both functional and visually aligned with the intended design.  
- **Visualization**: Creating the wireframe helped me understand the overall structure of the website and how different elements would come together.  
- **Design as a Foundation**: The wireframe served as a guide, making it easier to translate the design into fully functional web pages during the development process.

### Key Takeaways  
- Learned how to **design a website** and structure its layout using wireframes.  
- Developed a clearer understanding of how wireframes contribute to the development workflow.  
- Gained valuable insights into translating a design into **real-world webpages**.

### Reflection  
This task was incredibly helpful in bridging the gap between design and development. By visualizing the layout through wireframes, I was able to create webpages that closely resemble the original website.  
Designing the wireframe not only enhanced my skills but also gave me the confidence to approach web design systematically.
